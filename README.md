# mvvm-simple-ios
A simple movie listing example that gives an idea of MVVM Architecture with Alamofire

I used OMDB API to get movies. You should get an apikey with this url http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx to run the project. 1000 Daily Limit is free. You should choose that. Put this apikey in MovieService.swift file.

I used Breaking keyword to search movies from omdb. It can be changed with movieToSearch variable in MovieViewModel.swift.

Model is generated with https://app.quicktype.io/ quickly.
